SPLASH! consists of 3 defferent games: Snake, Sapper and Memo. You can navigate through the menu.

Reference: game Purble Place on Windows 7. It is very cool game and we liked playing it, so we chose similar colors.

Snake: you move tiny hungry snake so it eats and earns points for you. There are 3 levels, and speed changes with them.

Sapper: 10*15 field with 20 bombs hidden on it. Number in each square shows how many bombs are in the nearby 9 squares. You should avoid bombs by right-clicking them.

Memo: 3*4 field with 6 pairs of identical pictures. They show when you click on the card and stay unhidden if unmatched.

Good luck!
